    "## NLP Sentiment Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to create a proof-of-concept for sentiment analysis using existing NLP analysis library. The target corpus come from news articles that are published on the web, New York Times. Through this POC, it's desired to provide an example that qualitatively assesses the overall sentiment of article and how well the assessment aligns with human interpretation. A stretch goal of this POC includes automatically generating a summary of the article, which also gets qualitatively evaluated by human reader.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method\n",
    "For the NLP analytic library, the following library is used. () \n",
    "The target corpus comes from NYT website, and the total number of articles is 3. Each article has a different level sentiment.\n",
    "The human reader or interpretator is the author of this POC.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code\n",
    "The below block of code loads essential libraries for this project."
